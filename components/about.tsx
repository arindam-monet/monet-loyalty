        <p className="mt-8">
          We've pioneered the use of decentralized $POINTS on the blockchain,
          leveraging an L2 roll-up chain to establish an interoperable reward
          ecosystem. Our Oracles, powered by smart contracts, bridge the gap
          between traditional retail giants and the dynamic world of
          Web3-powered loyalty.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          By seamlessly integrating with major retail players, we bring
          unparalleled benefits to both businesses and consumers. Our AI-driven
          recommendations ensure that every reward is optimized for maximum
          utility, tailored to meet the unique needs of each user.
